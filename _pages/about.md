I am a fifth year PhD student in Electrical Engineering at New York University [Tandon School of Engineering](https://engineering.nyu.edu). I am part of the [NYU Wireless](https://wireless.engineering.nyu.edu) research center under the advisory of Professor Elza Erkip, [Commit Group](https://wp.nyu.edu/elza_erkip/). I received my B.S. in Electrical & Electronics Engineering and Physics (Double Major) from [Boğaziçi University](https://bogazici.edu.tr/en_US) (Istanbul, Turkey).

My current research interests are in Task-Oriented, Multiterminal Source Coding and Information Theory. I have previously worked on Physical Layer Security against Spoofing attacks. I enjoy working on Information Theory, Probability and Statistics and I have recently picked up an interest in Random Algorithms.

Outside work, I like exploring the city and I drink lots of coffee.
